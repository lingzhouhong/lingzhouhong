### Distributed networked learning with correlated data
  - __Period__: July. 2020 – Jun. 2021 
  - __Institution__: Texas A&M University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. Alfredo Garcia 
  - __Summary__: Proposed a distributed networked estimation in a setting with heterogeneous and correlated streams. Linear models are estimated locally subject to a network regularization term that penalizes a local model that differs from neighboring models. Analyzed computation dynamics and information exchange. Provided a finite-time characterization of convergence of the weighted ensemble average estimate and compare this result to federated learning.
  
###  Distributed Networked Real-time Learning
  - __Period__: Nov. 2019 – Jun. 2020
  - __Institution__: Texas A&M University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. Alfredo Garcia 
  - __Summary__: Proposed a distributed scheme for nonconvex and nonlinear system. Every local node implements stochastic gradient updates based upon a local data stream. To ensure robust estimation, a network regularization penalty is used to maintain a measure of cohesion in the ensemble of models. Showed the ensemble average approximates a stationary point and characterized the degree to which individual models differ from the ensemble average. 

### Distributed Approach for Generalized Least Squares Estimation
  - __Period__: Jan. 2019 – Jan. 2020 
  - __Institution__:Texas A&M University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. Alfredo Garcia
  - __Summary__:Considered a method for distributed estimation of a linear model by a network of local learners with heterogeneously distributed datasets. A network regularization penalty is used to ensure the ensemble average of local models approximates the solution to the generalized least squares estimation problem. Provided a finite-time characterization of convergence of the weighted ensemble average and compare this result to centralized estimation. 
  
### Optimal Gain for Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) in non-stationary system
  - __Period__: Jun. 2017 – Apr. 2018 
  - __Institution__: Johns Hopkins University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. James Spall
  - __Summary__:  Designed procedures to find the optimal step-sizes of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) in non-stationary systems to minimize the residuals between estimates and time-varying unknown parameters and evaluated the tracking performance.
  
### Optimal Baltimore Housing Demolition Strategies via Integer Programing
  - __Period__: Sept. 2016 – Apr. 2017
  - __Institution__: Johns Hopkins University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. Tamás Budavári
  - __Summary__: Provided in-depth analysis on the dynamics of vacant housing in Baltimore. Provided optimal demolish plans under various settings using integer optimization.
  
### Discussion on Step Length for Convex Optimization
  - __Period__: Apr. 2016 – May 2016 
  - __Institution__: Johns Hopkins University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. Daniel P. Robinson 
  - __Summary__: Computationally explored the effects of various step length choices on minimizing a convex objective function. Investigated advantages and disadvantages of each choice. 
  
###	Convexification in Unconstrained Continuous Optimization
  - __Period__: Jun. 2014 – Dec. 2014
  - __Institution__: Johns Hopkins University
  - __Advisor__: Prof. Daniel P. Robinson
  - __Summary__: Investigated the practical performance of commonly used convexification procedures, proposed a new convexification scheme, and demonstrated its superior performance.
